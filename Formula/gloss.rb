      Gloss drives a Chromium of its own. Download it once (about 150 MB,
      into Playwright's cache, ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright on macOS):
        gloss install-chromium

      To run reviews from Claude Code, add the plugin there:
        /plugin marketplace add ryanbrunner/gloss
        /plugin install gloss@gloss
